  PHASE 2: CORE INTELLIGENCE ENGINE

  Goal: Build robust audio and visual processing with quality metrics

  2.1 AUDIO INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM

  Modern Audio Processing Pipeline

  # core-svc/services/audio_processor.py
  class AudioProcessor:
      def __init__(self):
          self.vad = webrtcvad.Vad(2)
          self.device = torch.device("cuda")

      def process_audio(self, mp4_path: str) -> AudioAnalysis:
          # SoundFile + Torchaudio for GPU acceleration
          waveform, sample_rate = torchaudio.load(mp4_path)
          waveform = waveform.to(self.device)

          # VAD processing
          silence_segments = self.detect_silence(waveform)

          # Filler word detection
          filler_words = self.detect_filler_words(transcript, waveform)

          return AudioAnalysis(...)

  Intelligent Filler Word Detection

  - Hebrew Database: "אה", "אמ", "כאילו", "יעני", "אוקיי"
  - English Database: "um", "uh", "like", "you know", "actually"
  - Context Analysis: spaCy 3.8.7 with Hebrew tokenizer fixes
  - Confidence Scoring: Use WhisperX word-level probabilities
  - Language Detection: fasttext for per-sentence language
  identification

  Audio Quality Metrics

  - Cut-Smoothness Calculator: RMS delta ±50ms around cuts (target
  <-15dB)
  - Breathing Pattern Analysis: Detect natural vs artificial pauses
  - Speech Rate Analysis: Identify optimal cutting points based on
  pacing

  2.2 VISUAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM

  Modern Object Detection & Tracking

  # core-svc/services/visual_processor.py
  class VisualProcessor:
      def __init__(self):
          from mediapipe.tasks.python.vision import FaceDetector, FaceLandmarker

            self.detector = RTDETRv2()  # general object detection (unchanged)
            self.face_detector = FaceDetector.create_from_model_path("face_detector.task")
            self.face_landmarker = FaceLandmarker.create_from_model_path("face_landmarker.task")
            self.tracker = NorfairTracker() 


      def process_video(self, mp4_path: str) -> VisualAnalysis:
          # Object detection
          detections = self.detector.detect_video(mp4_path)

          # Face tracking
          face_tracks = self.track_faces(mp4_path)

          # Scene detection
          scenes = self.detect_scenes(mp4_path)

          return VisualAnalysis(...)

  Scene Analysis & Boundary Detection

  - PySceneDetect Integration: Content-aware scene change detection
  - Visual Momentum Analysis: Motion vector analysis for cut
  appropriateness
  - Composition Analysis: Rule of thirds, centering, visual balance
  - Lighting Consistency: Detect dramatic lighting changes

  Visual Quality Metrics

  - SSIM Analysis: Frame continuity measurement (target >0.4)
  - Motion Intensity Scoring: Identify calm vs high-energy segments
  - Face Tracking Quality: Confidence and consistency metrics

 Landmark-Guided Reframing (New Section)
The Face Landmarker tracks 6 facial landmarks (eyes, nose tip, mouth center, and ears), enabling:

Accurate face-centered vertical cropping (9:16 or 4:5)

Stability during subtle head movements or turns

Automatic head tilt correction in reframing

Quality scoring of cuts based on landmark drift or occlusion

Combined with the Norfair tracker, landmarks are smoothed over time to avoid jitter. When landmarks drop below confidence thresholds, a fallback 4:5 center crop is applied.

  2.3 PROXY VIDEO GENERATION

  Responsive UI Strategy

  - Proxy Creation: Generate 480p versions during analysis for timeline
   scrubbing
  - Smart Caching: Store proxy files for quick UI loading
  - Thumbnail Generation: Extract keyframes for timeline visualization
  - WebGL Integration: Prepare video format for web-based editing

  Celery Task Pipeline

  # Parallel processing for efficiency
  from celery import group

  def analyze_project(project_id: str, mp4_path: str):
      tasks = group(
          analyze_audio.s(project_id, mp4_path),
          analyze_video.s(project_id, mp4_path),
          generate_proxy.s(project_id, mp4_path)
      )
      return tasks.apply_async()

  DELIVERABLES

  - ✓ Audio processing with filler word detection
  - ✓ Visual processing with face/object tracking
  - ✓ Scene boundary detection working
  - ✓ Quality metrics calculation
  - ✓ Proxy video generation
  - ✓ Language detection for Hebrew/English
  - 6-point facial landmarks tracked with >95% stability
  - Face reframing remains smooth and centered during subtle motion

  - Face stays within vertical crop zone in >95% of frames

  SUCCESS CRITERIA

  - Filler words detected with >90% accuracy
  - Face tracking maintains ID through 95% of video
  - Scene boundaries align with natural content breaks
  - Audio quality metrics match manual analysis
  - Proxy videos load and play smoothly in browser

  IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

  PHASE DEPENDENCY FLOW:
  Foundation (3-4 weeks) → Intelligence (4-5 weeks) → EDL Engine (3-4
  weeks) → Manual Editor (6-8 weeks) → Production (2-3 weeks)

  Total Implementation: 18-24 weeks

  Getting Started

  1. Week 1: Set up repository structure and Docker environment
  2. Week 2: Implement basic FastAPI endpoints and Celery tasks
  3. Week 3: Add file upload and basic project management
  4. Week 4: Begin audio processing implementation

  Each phase includes comprehensive testing and validation before
  proceeding to the next phase. This ensures a stable foundation for
  the sophisticated manual editing capabilities that distinguish this
  system from basic automated tools.

  The incremental approach allows for early validation of concepts
  while building toward a production-ready system that rivals Opus Clip
   quality with unprecedented user control.
